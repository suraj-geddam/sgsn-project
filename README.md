## RL Models for Poker

First, install the torch implementation of RLCard by the following command (from the RLCard instructions):
```
pip3 install rlcard[torch]
```
Then, to run the training and evaluation script, use
```
bash train_and_evaluate.sh
```
For only training, you can use `bash train.sh` and if training has already been done, evaluation can be run by `bash evaluate.sh`.
