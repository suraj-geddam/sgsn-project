## RL Models for Poker

Make sure you have torch installed.
Then, navigate to the rlcard directory and install RLcard by the following command:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
Then, to run the training and evaluation script, use
```
bash train_and_evaluate.sh
```
For only training, you can use `bash train.sh` and if training has already been done, evaluation can be run by `bash evaluate.sh`.

Thanks to the authors of RLCard and this implementation of PPO!
